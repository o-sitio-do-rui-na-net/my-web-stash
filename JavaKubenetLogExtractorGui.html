<h2>Initial Problem:</h2>
<p>This program was initially conceived as a <strong>Gui</strong> for a command line command runner for Kubernetes <em>k get logs *** -n **</em> command and other frequent commands that monitor a Kubernetes system.</p>
<p>However, the limitation was that the program had to be built using only <strong>java 1.8</strong> due to being the only available that could interact with windows command line available inside of a Citrix Windows Virtual Environment that had access to the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>A simple batch script could take care of the engine to run Kubernetes commands and switch some placeholders for actual pod/namespace names however, it wouldn’t give us the Gui with buttons that we needed for user experience.</p>
<h2>Choosing of Technologies:</h2>
<p><strong>Java 1.8</strong> was the way to go, a <em>jre</em> pretty much the was the only thing available on the machine that could run our idea on. As supported in Initial problem.</p>
<p>The Gui was built with <strong>Swing</strong> since as opposed to <em>jfx</em> hasn’t yet been discontinued and it’s a commonly known technology that can be used with Window Builder and not only that people are familiarized with it so it would also be familiar to maintain in the future.</p>


<h2>Basics for the construction of a Java program to run commands on the windows command line:</h2>
<p>This is essentially resolving / developing a around the following lines of code:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    <span class="function-name">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> openCmdWindowAndRunCommand(<span class="string">String command</span>) <span class="keyword">throws</span> IOException , InterruptedException  {
      Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
    }
  </code>
</pre>
<p>or in most cases like:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
      <span class="keyword">public</span> Process openCmdWindowAndRunCommand(<span class="string">String comando</span>) <span class="keyword">throws</span> IOException, InterruptedException {
        Process process;
        <span class="keyword">try</span> {
          process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(comando);
        } <span class="keyword">catch</span> (IOException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
          <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">null</span>;
        }

        <span class="keyword">return</span> process;
      }
    </code>
  </pre>

<p>This will execute in the windows command line a string command. This could be something like a <em>“k get pods -n abc”</em> or a <em>“java -version”</em>, a <em>curl</em>, an <em>ftp</em> you get the idea. However, when java runs a command, it does not open the command line! You don’t see it!</p>
<p>To counter that if you think about it, you will just need to run a command to open a command line window to run another command inside that opened window. Luckily there is an easy implementation to that which is just wrapping your commands as follows:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
      <span class="keyword">String</span> ABRIR_O_CMD=<span class="string">"cmd /c start cmd.exe /K \"echo hello Rui! \""</span>;
    </code>
  </pre>
<p>The rest of the algorithms should reside in swapping character placeholders in your string commands :D</p>
<p>These are pretty much the two main features on how to achieve a program like this using Java syntax.</p>

<h2>Gui</h2>
<p>It obviously looks like a Java swing application :D although that might seem a little bit outdated its usefulness helps team members that used it saving a lot of time over typing these same commands.</p>
